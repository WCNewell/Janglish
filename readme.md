## Janglish 

My very first app! This is a fun tool that translates any English phrase you enter one of several different languages including Zulu, Hindi, Swedish, and many more via Google API. The app is written in vanilla JavaScript, HTML5,uses Bootsrapp/CSS for styling, and conntects to a local API for random language code generation. the app includes a basic Cypress test and is deployed to Firebase.
